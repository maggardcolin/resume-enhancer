### Summary
- Our goal for this project is to create a sophisticated Python program that enhances resumes, with the intention to be more appealing to potential employers. 
- We created a dynamic dataset with the implementation of advanced web scraping techniques. This tool goes through job listings on Indeed.com to identify crucial requirements and keywords. 
- It aims to bridge the gap between job seekers' resumes and the expectations of companies, ensuring your resume stands out in the competitive job market.

### Objectives
- To create a dynamic dataset of frequently used keywords by web scraping Indeed and cleaning it manually and with Natural Language Toolkit
- To compare the user’s resume to this dataset relating to their desired job field
- To create an ATS compliant resume based on the user’s input

### Features

- Install necessary dependencies, which may be limited to pip but more testing is needed (may include selenium, nltk, pandas, and python-docx).
- Run the Application: Start the application and follow the prompts directed by the application.
- Review Results: Analyze the score and feedback provided by the tool to make necessary improvements to your resume.
